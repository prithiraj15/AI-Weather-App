# AiWeatherApp


## Overview

This is a simple web application that displays the current weather based on the user's geolocation using the OpenWeatherMap API. It includes an integrated AI chatbot powered by Google's Gemini API, which can respond to user queries with weather context (e.g., temperature-based suggestions). The chatbot supports formatted responses, typing indicators, and optional image placeholders for visuals.

The app is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and easy to deploy. It's fully responsive for mobile and desktop devices.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Display**: Fetches and shows current temperature, location, description, humidity, and wind speed using geolocation.
- **AI Chatbot**: Floating chat icon opens a modal for messaging. Responses are generated by Gemini API, incorporating weather data.
- **Formatted Responses**: Supports bold, italic, line breaks, and embedded weather images via placeholders (e.g., [image: rainy]).
- **Typing Indicator**: Shows "AI is typing..." while waiting for API responses.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with clean UI elements like rounded buttons and message bubbles.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling for geolocation errors, API failures, and empty messages.

## Setup API Keys

This app requires two API keys:

- **OpenWeatherMap API Key**: Sign up at [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api) and get a free key. Replace the placeholder in `script.js`:
  ```javascript
  const WEATHER_API_KEY = 'your-openweathermap-api-key';
  ```
- **Gemini API Key**: Get it from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). Replace in `script.js`:
  ```javascript
  const GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your-gemini-api-key';
  ```

## Usage

1. Open the app in a browserâ€”it will request geolocation permission to fetch your local weather.
2. View weather details in the central card.
3. Click the floating chat icon (ðŸ’¬) in the bottom-right to open the chatbot.
4. Type a message (e.g., "What should I wear today?") and send. The AI will respond based on current weather.
5. If the response includes a placeholder like `[image: sunny]`, it will render as an embedded image.

Example Query: "Is it cold outside?"  
AI Response: Might include temperature details and an image icon.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structure and styling.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: For API calls, DOM manipulation, and logic.
- **APIs**:
  - OpenWeatherMap for weather data.
  - Google Gemini for AI-generated responses.
- **No Frameworks**: Pure vanilla JS for simplicity and learning purposes.
